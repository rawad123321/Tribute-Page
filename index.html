        Albert Einstein, one of the most influential physicists in history, was
        born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany. Renowned for his groundbreaking
        contributions to the field of theoretical physics, Einstein is best
        known for developing the theory of relativity, which transformed our
        understanding of space, time, and gravity. His iconic equation, E=mc²,
        encapsulates the profound connection between energy and mass. Beyond his
        scientific achievements, Einstein was a passionate advocate for pacifism
        and social justice, and his unique appearance and playful demeanor
        endeared him to the public. Einstein's legacy extends far beyond the
        realm of physics, making him a symbol of intellectual curiosity,
        innovation, and the pursuit of knowledge for the betterment of humanity.

    <h1>Albert Einstein Private Life.</h1>
    <h4>
      <b>
        <i> Albert Einstein was married twice in his lifetime: </i>
      </b>
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Mileva Marić:</b> Einstein's first wife was Mileva Marić, whom he
        married in 1903. Mileva was also a physicist, and they had two sons
        together, Hans Albert and Eduard. The couple faced personal and
        professional challenges, and they eventually divorced in 1919.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b> Elsa Einstein:</b>After his divorce from Mileva, Albert Einstein
        married his first cousin, Elsa Einstein, in 1919. Elsa had two daughters
        from her previous marriage, Ilse and Margot. Albert and Elsa remained
        married until her death in 1936.
      </li>

    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Lieserl Einstein:</b>Lieserl was born in early 1902, but very little
        is known about her. There are historical records suggesting she might
        have been given up for adoption or died in infancy. Unfortunately, the
        details of her life remain largely unknown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hans Albert Einstein:</b> Born on May 14, 1904, Hans Albert was
        Einstein's first son with his first wife, Mileva Marić. He went on to
        become a hydraulic engineer and a professor of civil engineering.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Eduard "Tete" Einstein:</b>Eduard, also known as "Tete," was born on
        July 28, 1910. He was Einstein's second son with Mileva. Eduard suffered
        from mental health issues, and his relationship with his father was
        complex. Eduard spent much of his life in psychiatric care.
      </li>

    <h4>
      <b>
        <i>Albert Einstein's last days.</i>
      </b>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Albert Einstein's last days were marked by declining health. In the final
      years of his life, Einstein struggled with health issues, including
      internal bleeding related to the rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
      Despite undergoing surgery to repair the aneurysm, his condition continued
      to deteriorate. In the later stages of his illness, Einstein expressed a
      wish to die at home, but due to his critical condition, he was admitted to
      Princeton Hospital. On April 18, 1955, at the age of 76, Albert Einstein
      passed away at Princeton Hospital. The cause of death was reported as an
      abdominal aortic aneurysm.
